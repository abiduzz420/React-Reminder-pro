/*

my secret formula for understanding redux!

1)Add a constant to the constants file. Something like `const GREAT_COURSE = â€˜GREAT_COURSE`

2)Add an action creator to the actions folder. Return an action JavaScript object with a type of the constant you created.

3)Add a reducer to the reducers folder that handles this action creator.
